### Beaver Works Summer Institute

Beaver Works Summer Institute is a STEM summer program run by MIT and MIT Lincoln Laboratories. The program started in 2016 with an Autonomous Racecar program. Since then, the program has grown. In 2017, Beaver Works expanded and started an Autonomous UAV program as well as an Automated Cognitive Assistant (CogWorks) program. By 2019, Beaver Works expanded to 10 programs, one of them being Remote Sensing for Crisis Response.

### Remote Sensing for Crisis Response

The Remote Sensing course invites 15 high school students from across the country to work on imaging, data analysis, and decision making to help them make optimal decisions for crisis response. Throughout the course, students learn to process satellite imagery and large datasets to analyze areas during crisis response. The JEFFRIS project, the week 3 project for the course, involves students capturing and processing their own aerial images. These images are taken by configuring Raspberry Pis and placing them on kites. The students have the ability to take a variety of images, including standard and infrared images through the use of filters. The students then create or implement algorithms that analyze the images using methods scalable for crisis response.
